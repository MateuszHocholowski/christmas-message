    <div class="greeting">Dear James,</div>
    <p>I hope you've been good all year; if so, proceed with opening the present!</p>
    <p>Since my handwriting isn't the best, I decided to use this way to wish you and your whole family a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!</p>
    <p>As part of your Christmas gift, I've collected a few items that I hope you will find interesting and enjoyable:</p>
    <div class="items">
        <p><span class="item-title">1. The Cyberiad</span> – This is a book by Poland's most acclaimed sci-fi/fantasy author, <strong>Stanisław Lem</strong>.</p>
        <p><span class="item-title">2. Neuroshima Hex</span> – This is a board game that is very popular around here, so I figured it's unlikely you already have it in your arsenal. It's suitable for 2–4 players, fast-paced, and the gameplay is relatively short. I'm sure you'll enjoy playing it with the boys or some friends.</p>
        <p><span class="item-title">3. Scout Cross</span> – This one, I hope, will pique your interest as you are deeply involved in scouting. The Scout Cross is a badge/award granted to Polish scouts who prove themselves worthy. Only after receiving this cross can one truly call themselves a scout and wear it on their uniform. It carries significant symbolism (I'm sure you can find articles about it if you're interested) and a rich history.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="history">
        During WWII, Polish scouting was highly involved in the underground anti-occupation movement under the codename <strong>Grey Ranks</strong>, which gives this badge great meaning to Polish scouts today. This particular cross belonged to me, and I hope you'll find an opportunity to share its story with Scottish scouts, giving it a purpose beyond lying at the bottom of a closet.
    </div>
    <p>Anyway, sorry for the long letter! All the best to you, Eilidh, the boys, and both your families!</p>
    <div class="signature">Merry Christmas!<br>Santaragan</div>
